### **What You Have Just Built**

Now, when you go to your live website, you will see your red car again. But this time, it is alive!

*   **On a computer:** Try pressing the **left and right arrow keys**. You will see your car move smoothly from side to side!
*   **On your phone:** **Tap the left half of the game screen** to move left. **Tap the right half of the game screen** to move right.

You have just created your first interactive game loop. This is the absolute core of all video games, from the simplest to the most complex.

Please, go and update your file. When you have successfully driven your car left and right, come back and tell me:

**"My car is moving!"**

And then, we will add the next exciting feature: the enemy cars to dodge! Congratulations on this huge step, Suleiman
